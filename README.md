# Waitlist-Checker

### A quick Python script that will text you if a class opens up at UMD!

##### To get running:
1. Set class code and section number (which is the literal number the section is from the top on Testudo)
3. Sign up for a free Twilio account and fill in the data in the script (using 10-digit numbers)
4. Run `nohup python3 waitlist.py &` (on a Raspberry Pi or similar device ideally)
